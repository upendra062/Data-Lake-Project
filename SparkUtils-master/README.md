# SparkUtils
This Scala Maven project contains various utility methods which can be reused across Spark Processing code.

The set of utility includes logging, trimming, regex replace, time related functions, file/ directory handling functions, sequence generator and data quality checks like validate not null and validate column length. You can do SCD Type 2 CDC loads as well using the CDC utility.

Happy Coding!
